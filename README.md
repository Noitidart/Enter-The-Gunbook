Quick access to the item data from the official Enter the Gungeon Wiki.

This is a mobile app designed for Android and iOS. It uses speech recognition from IBM Bluemix API to find results from the official Gamepedia.

While I play the "Enter the Gungeon" I am constantly typing on my device to find stats on the gun/item I just picked up. I created this speech based app to help me stay in the game while doing a much quicker item lookup.
